Greetings

Thankyou for checking this project out! 

As mentioned in the description this is a legacy project from 2024 from my first software development bootcamp where we learned how to create a back-end with ASP.NET Web API, .NET 6 and Swagger UI, 
it is not and won't be worked on with any updates despite any issues that the project has as it was only created as a way to learn and test crud operations, services and other topics/aspects.
